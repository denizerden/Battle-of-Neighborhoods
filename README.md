The premise of this investigation is to help a little gathering of speculators intending to open their first U.S. based bottling works/eatery extension in Toronto. Being that Toronto is the most populated city in Canada, and constantly positions as a significant worldwide city dependent on a high caliber of living, the decision to venture into the neighbor of the north market was a simple choice for the contributing gathering.So as part of this project , we will list and visualise all major parts of Toronto that has great Italian restaurants.
