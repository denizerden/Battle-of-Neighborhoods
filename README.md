# Battle-of-Neighborhoods

## 1-Introduction

Toronto is the capital and most populous city of Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 as 2016. The city limits cover an area of 2,511 square kilometers, while the metropolitan area covers over 26,000 square kilometers, Moscow is among the world’s largest cities, being the most popular city in Europe. This is why I choose the Toronto for my project.

Current to 2016, the Toronto evaluation metropolitan zone (CMA), of which the larger part is inside the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most crowded CMA and the fourth most crowded city in North America. Toronto is a universal focus of business, account, expressions, and culture, and is perceived as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan urban areas on the planet. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants.

Problem is if you want to open a restaurant in Toronto, which world cuisine it should be according to people’s rankings to restaurants in Toronto.
